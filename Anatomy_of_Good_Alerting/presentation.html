    <!-- 
        Throughout this slide deck you will see a lot of empty div's. This is because I am using custom css grids with the following spacing:
        1fr 10fr 1fr
        This is to help deal with different screen/projector resolutions. It makes the code look slightly messy but I always want the main elements 
        in the middle div so that it displays correctly. This is my first attempt at html/css in over 10 years. I am sure there are a lot of things 
        that could be improved upon
